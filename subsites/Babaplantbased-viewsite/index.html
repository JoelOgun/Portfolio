      <h2>What is this page about?</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of Baba Brooklyn Plant Based Community Group is to build
        stronger, healthier, and more sustainable communities. This is being
        accomplished through a wide range of research, policy, and program
        activities and working with local nonprofits, businesses, governments,
        hospitals and other health-related organizations, faith-based groups,
        and other community organizations.

      <h2>Tell Me More</h2>
      <p>
        A plant-based diet helps maintain a healthy weight. Staying at a healthy
        weight is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your
        risk for cancer. When it comes to cancer, the only thing more important
        than maintaining a healthy weight, is not smoking.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is because excess weight causes inflammation and hormonal
        imbalance. If you are overweight or obese, your risk is higher for 12
        different types of cancer including colorectal, post-menopausal breast,
        uterine, esophageal, kidney and pancreatic cancers.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you eat mostly plants, you remove many of the foods that lead to
        weight gain. Add in exercise and you’re on a path towards weight loss.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Even a plant-based meal relies on you to avoid the major diet pitfalls,
        like sugar and fat. Using healthy cooking methods and knowing how to
        make the most of your vegetables can help you get all the benefits a
        plant-based diet offers. This means deep-fried vegetables are out. So
        are highly processed foods like crackers and cookies. Limit sugary
        desserts as well and make sure you are picking whole grains. Regular
        pasta, white bread and white rice may be plant products, but they are
        not made from whole grains. Choose 100% whole wheat pasta and bread, and
        eat brown rice. Choosing plants will help all your body’s systems work
        the best they can. “We just have to eat plants. They are so important
        for our body’s long term health,” says Murray.
